# Stock
This is a practice implementation of a stock class in Java

Create a Java class named Stock (in a file called Stock.java) to represent the concept of a
stock from the stock market. The class contains:
A string data field named symbol for the stock’s symbol.
A string data field named name for the stock’s name.
A double data field named previousClosingPrice that stores the closing stock price
for the previous day.
A double data field named currentPrice that stores the stock price for the current
time.
A constructor that creates a stock with the specified symbol and name.
A method named getChangePercent() that returns the percentage changed from the
previousClosingPrice to the currentPrice.

Write a test program with the main method (in a file called TestStock.java) that creates a
Stock object with the Stock symbol LKSS, the name Limerick Software Solutions. The
previous closing price should be set to 79.45 and the current price should be set to 79.65.
Display, on standard output, the stock name and the percentage change in the price from
the previous closing price to the current price.
